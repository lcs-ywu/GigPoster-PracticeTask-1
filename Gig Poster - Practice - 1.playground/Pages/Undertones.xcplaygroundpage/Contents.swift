//: # Gig Poster - Practice Task 1
//: The following two statements are required to make the playground run. Please do not remove.

/*:
 Each image is exactly 400 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall. 
 
 Your goal is to precisely reproduce this image: 
 
 ![undertones-no-grid](undertones-no-grid.png "Undertones")
 ![undertones-with-grid](undertones-with-grid.png "Undertones")

 By precisely reproducing this image, you will demonstrate your understanding of:
 
 * sequence (order of statements in a program)
 * conditionals (making decisions with ``if`` statements)
 * iteration (use of loops to repeat statements)
 
 You may use the color constants created below to obtain the correct colors.
 
 Remember that you can refer to the [Canvas class documentation](https://www.russellgordon.ca/canvasgraphics/documentation/classes/canvas), as needed.

// Create a new canvas
let canvas = Canvas(width: 400, height: 600)

// COLORS
let lightGrey = Color(hue: 84, saturation: 6, brightness: 88, alpha: 100)
let deepRed = Color(hue: 7, saturation: 97, brightness: 72, alpha: 100)

// Begin your solution here...
